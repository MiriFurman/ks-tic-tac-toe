### Task1, browser tests
1. Write an e2e test two '+' operations (for example: 2 + 3 + 4 = 9)
2. Write an e2e test for reset input value: add a button 'C', which clears the input value
3. (bonus) Write a test for "reset all": after first click on 'C' it becomes 'AC'. Pressing it will reset everything (including prevValue state)
